# INTRODUCTION TO AWARD

AWARD is a non-profit organization specializing in multi-disciplinary, participatory, research-based project implementation aimed at addressing issues of sustainability, inequity, and poverty within the fields of natural resource management and sustainability. Our focus is mainly on integrated and adaptive water resources management, livelihoods, and the risks imposed by climate change and other factors. We strive to work collaboratively with other organizations to develop strong and rich professional networks and competence in civil society, government agencies, and private enterprise. We believe this will help provide a foundation for robust and sustainable development policy and practice that can build resilience in a complex world.

## VISION

Our vision is to contribute to a more sustainable world and in particular to a democratic South Africa where the principles of equity and sustainability are upheld and strengthened through building active civil society participation in wise water and biodiversity stewardship, management, and governance.

## MISSION

Our mission is to develop, test, and inform new and appropriate ways of managing water and biodiversity so as to contribute to sustainable futures that promote the dignity of all.

We seek to do this through:
- Research-based, participatory enquiry and implementation.
- Communicating and sharing our learning and findings.
- Influencing and supporting institutions with responsibility for policy and implementation.
- Working with approaches that support the livelihoods of the vulnerable and poor.
- Adopting innovative approaches that support transformation in line with the vision.
- Adopting systemic approaches in support of catchment-based water resources management and regional biodiversity initiatives.
- Adopting a social learning orientation towards capacity development.
- Developing E-learning platforms that support inclusive and interactive training.
- Developing decision support systems that assist with monitoring, analysis, and sound and systemic decision-making.

## PRINCIPLES

- Think across disciplines, boundaries, and systems.
- Merge considerations from environmental, technical, and social perspectives.
- Design practical interventions to address the vulnerability of people and ecosystems.
